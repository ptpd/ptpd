README for PTPd Version 2.x

- Introduction -

This is the source code for the PTP daemon (PTPd) implementing the
Precision Time Protocol (PTP) version 2 as defined by 'IEEE Std 1588-2008'. PTP
provides precise time coordination of Ethernet LAN connected computers. It
was designed primarily for instrumentation and control systems.

- Use -

PTPd can coordinate the clocks of a group of LAN connected computers with each
other. It has been shown to achieve microsecond level coordination, even on
limited platforms.

The 'ptpd' program can be built from the included source code.  To use
the program, run 'ptpd' on a group of LAN connected computers. Compile
with 'PTPD_DBG' defined and run with the '-c' argument to watch what's
going on.

If you are just looking for software to update the time on your desktop, you
probably want something that implements the Network Time Protocol. It can
coordinate computer clocks with an absolute time reference such as UTC.

Please refer to the INSTALL file for build instructions and configuration
options. Please refer to the README.repocheckout file for information
on how to build from source code repositories.
