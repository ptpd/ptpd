	* 2.3.2 release

	* Bug fixes / improvements since 2.3.1:

	- systemd service file added and RPM spec updated
	  to handle systemd
	- fixed segfault when shutting down NTP time service
	- ptpengine:always_respect_utc_offset is now enabled
	  by default, to protect from clock jumps when GM
	  stops announcing currentUtcOffsetValid flag
	- re-arranged order of InterfaceInfo fields to
	  fix memory alignment issues (SF bug #70)
	- corrected logMessageInterval field values
	  for hybrid mode (SF bug #69)
	- fixed NTPd check failures resulting from signals
	  interrupting select()
	- increased statistics file line buffer size to prevent
	  truncation and merging of lines
	- added Sequence ID to statistics log
	- Solaris build fixes - linking lnsl and lsocket when
	  building without SNMP support
	- critical: added minimum POSIX timer interval to prevent from
	  timers firing to quickly for the process to handle,
	  resulting in 100% CPU and endless signal queue
	- improved processing of unicast destination, domain
	  and local preference lists
	- CPU affinity setting moved to a separate function
	- fixed incorrect PTP_UNICAST flag setting for multicast
	- fixed missing management or signalling message acceptance
	  condition (clockid==clockid, portid=0xffff): ISPCS 2015 plugfest,
	  fourth missing: (clockid=0x(f), portid==portid)
	- signaling.c: fixed order of grant processing for PTP messages
	  (ann,syn,fup,dresp,pdelayresp) instead of numeric loop,
	  to assist with interop where transmission request order
	  makes a difference to the master
	- signaling.c: do not reset known clock ID when changing GMs,
	  to allow to keep accepting announce from other masters
	- signaling.c: update unicast index when transport address
	  match only: fix for cache misses for non-best masters
	- daemonconfig:c - reworked all config mapping macros
	  to functions, parseConfig now handless all operations:
	  parsing, quiet parsing, reload check, help - no hidden
	  values in dictionary anymore
	- closed sf bug #64 - leaving mcast group with 0x0 address
	- peer multicast group only joined when needed, not always
	- logMessage now keeps hash of the last message body,
	  preventing from same message being repeated
	- null checks getInterfaceInfo set of helper functions
	  in case if some data returned by getifaddrs() is null:
	  fixes segfaults on some exotic interface types
	- signaling.c: use message type <-> smaller index number
	  conversion so grant table is 5-element, not 16-element:
	  significantly reduced memory footprint
	- added dummy Makefile to src/dep to allow make commands
	  from that directory
	- added buffer overflow protection for management
	  TLVs: protects against read past message length,
	  and against read past buffer space

	* New features since 2.3.1:

	- support for user variables in configuration:
	    - variables specified variables:name=val, and
	      used as @name@
	    - built-in variables: @pid@, @hostname@
	- support for configuration templates:
	    - built-in
	    - template files
	- unicast port number mask to assist with nodes
	  using different port IDs for negotiation
	- option to accept any GM when unicast negotiation
	  is enabled
	- UDP checksums disabled on Linux by default:
	  enables interop with TCs that don't correct checksums
	- Added QNX support:
	    - clean build on QNX 6.5 out of the box  
	    - adjfreq emulation using native ClockAdjust
	    - binding to CPU cores
	    - Experimental (but yield best results):
		* interpolated getTime attached to IRQ0
		* RX/TX timestamps in software on send or receive,
		  bypassing pcap or socket timestamping
	- support for systems without getopt_long (like QNX)
	- adjfreq-like behaviour on systems with adjtime only:
	  properly scaled adjtime() pulled into PI servo
	  (vastly improved sync on systems like OpenBSD and OSX),
	  support for drift file for those systems
	- fixed preserving incorrect master address when
	  best master lowers priority (GM change as a result
	  of announce from current master, not foreign)
	- PTP MIB enhanced with string values, counter support,
	  clearing counters and more, added some missing items
	  from previously supported items
	- SNMP trap support for common alarm conditions
	- enhanced management message support: enable/disable port,
	  some missing values, PTPd now properly applies
	  configuration when receiving SET messages
	- added simple SNMP poller script: snmptpq
	- SNMP MIB now using PTPd's own Enterprise number

	     * disabling BMCA for masters (also works for multicast)
	     * support for slaves with masters in multiple domains
	     * influencing slave BMCA with local preference
	     * serving multiple Telecom slaves at different rates
	     * slaves correctly negotiate message rates over supported
	       range of intervals until an acceptable interval is granted
	  + support for unicast Peer Delay target - exotic use case
	- greatly improved network robustness
	- added support for slave-only builds (configure --slave-only):
	  allows building a binary incapable of running as master
	- simple failover mechanism - ptpengine:backup_interface
	- ptpengine:max_delay_max_rejected setting to unblock ptpd
	  rejecting all messages when max_delay set
	- ptpengine:max_delay_stable to only use max_dely when clock
	  is stable

	- ptpd now compiles and runs out of he box on NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD,
	  OSX and Solaris and its derivatives (OpenIndiana, OmniOS etc.)
	- major rework of the ACL code
	- outlier filter auto-tune to improve operation in noisy environments(high PDV)
	- added support for statistical filters (min/mean/median) for sync 
	  and delay messages - min or median can be used in envifonments with high PDV
	- added small step detection (millisecond level)
	- added ptpengine:clock_update_timeout setting to reset slave
	  if no clock updates for a period of time
	- when running slave-only in unicast mode, unicast address

	- automatic Delay Request override for Hybrid and Unicast modes
	- added options allowing to step the clock on startup
	- improved sequence and re-ordering checks
	- added support for "any domain" operation where ptpd will sync with
	  any available domain
	- idle timeout (PTPd hands over clock control)

	- maximum state machine reset count - full network restart when exceeded:
	  allows ptpd to survive situations where network interface is removed,
	  shut down or IP address changes

	- configurable leap second handling: accept, ignore, step
	- support for leap second smear for slave operation
	- option to step clock on startup
	- TimingDomain API: all NTP failover code removed
	  in favour of a generic interface for multiple time controllers.

	  from statistics file: allows sending statistics into syslog
	- support for software transmit timestamping on Linux

	  no transport information available
	- added periodic status updates to log file (global:periodic_updates)
	- status file will always display counters for common error events
	  if they are non-zero (includes denied unicast grants and ignored
	  Announce resulting from rejected UTC properties)
	- reporting on message receive and transmit rates
	  in the status file
	- restored compatibility with 802.1AS

	* Bug fixes / improvements since 2.3.0:

	- added CentOS / RHEL 7.x support
	- statistics code enabled by default - can be disabled
	- NTPd failover code enabled by default - can be disabled
	- Improved status file - more error conditions included,
	  message performance statistics included
	- Rewritten timer subsystem allowing for easily implementing
	  other implementations: included is the old interval timer implementation,
	  and new (now default), POSIX timer implementation. This allows for
	  fully standards-compliant message rates. This can be disabled with
	  a configure flag
	- ptpd now usable on systems with no adjtimex() call like OSX,
	  OpenBSD and LynxOS ()
	- moving standard deviation algorithm fix improving the outlier
	  filters
	- major servo.c spaghetti code cleanups
	- network code cleanup
	- fixed bug #66 - Ethernet interfaces no longer need IP addresses

	   best master
	- improved servo stability detection: servo no longer reporting
	  stable when discarding most samples or heavily slewing
	- ptpd will now join and leave multicast groups only when running
	  multicast or hybrid: allows running unicast and multicast
	  independently
	- ptpd will now ignore unicast packets in multicast-only mode
	  and vice versa. In hybrid mode, only unicast Delay Request /
	  response is accepted; multicast management messages are always
	  accepted
	- further autoconf improvements across all supported OSes
	- added missing files to distribution
	- ptpd will now recover even from critical network failures,
	  such as reloading drivers
	- remaining memory leaks fixed
	- more code cleanup, no more ajtimex() and similar calls in protocol.c
	- some refactoring, constified rtOpts wherever possible
	- less "dramatic" warnings about drift file
	  and clock stability detection
	- fixed unnecessary TX timestamp attempts in PCAP mode
	- fixed issue where drift file would not be correctly
	  written on exit under certain conditions
	- other minor bugs fixed

		maximum frequency offset is now configurable and can be above 512 ppm - tick is used above 512 ppm,
	- Added a compatibility option to always honour the UTC offset announced by a GM when in slave state
	- Added an announce receipt timeout "grace period" for slave state
	  	slave can wait n times timeout without fully resetting
	  	allows a seamless failover without resetting delay values etc.,
	- Added support for DELAY_DISABLED delay mode - syntonisation only
	- Initial support for informing the clock subsystem about the sync status
		STA_UNSYNC is unset when adjusting the clock (allows syncing hardware RTC clocks with the system clock)

	  blocks / filters spikes from delayMS and delaySM 
	- Generic PI controler model
	- P and I components changed from attenuations to gains

	- NTPd integration and failover
		ptpd can now connect to local ntpd using mode 7 packets (code derived from ntpdc)
	  	and using authenticated requests can enable/disable ntpd clock control.
	  		Enable with configure --enable-ntpdc
	- Dump counters + clear counters using a SIGUSR2 handler to dump all counters to the log file
	  	configure --enable-sigusr2=counters

	- Control over tick rate on Linux, allowing faster clock slewing if needed


	  		  
	* Bug fixes:
	
	- TTL no longer defaults to 64 in P2P mode - in P2P it's set to 1,
	- Fixed an issue whereby observed drift would be reset to 0 if it
	  could not be read from the drift file (empty or nonexistent drift file),
	  now the kernel value is used if read from file fails.
	 - Support for updating utmp/wtmp when stepping the clock (FR #38)
	 - Mean Path Delay filtering now done in float (patch #49)
	 - Multiple other SourceForge bugs closed: Bugs closed:

		    #27, #48, #54, #47, #40, #37, #53, #50, #52, #59, #60 
	
	* Cleanups and other changes:
	
	- Major startup.c cleanup, removed the parallel daemon checks,
	  in favour of better lock handling and the automatic lock file
	  name support,
	- Some minor refactoring,
	- Added a TimePropertiesDS structure and removed its fields
	  from PtpClock
	- Improved log file format with full date and interface name,
	  removed the "===" indents
	- Delay Request interval no longer mandatory in hybrid mode,
	  but a warning will be issued if it's not explicitly defined -
	  default of 0 is used,
	- Removed the experimental status of hybrid mode,
	- Manual stepping of the clock no longer just resets the observed
	  drift: resets it or restores it based on the drift handling setting,
	  and sets the time immediately before writing any logs - this allows
	  to re-sync and stabilise time almost instantly
	- Up to date man pages written
