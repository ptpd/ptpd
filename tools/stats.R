# Description: A tool, written in R, that will process a PTPd log and
# give various statistics about PTP performance.  Statistics are given
# for the offset from master (Offset), one way delay (Delay), Master
# to Slave and Slave to Master timings.  An argument is required which
# is a raw ptpd log produced by the -D flag to ptpd2.
